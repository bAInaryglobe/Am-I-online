In rare cases, you don't know whether you are truly offline or...hacked🤔

Run the "question.py" to perform basic checks to know if you are truly offline, or it's bad internet, or...you never know😅

 If you don't have python installed👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽
 
the online version of the code should be used if you don't have python installed. It should be opened by your browser 

NB: There is an online demo here https://bainaryglobe.github.io/Am-I-online-for-MacOs/. However, note that the source for this page is designed to be run opened in your local browser. Performing the check in this online page will not give you accurate information (Since you have to be online to even be able to check in this manner)
